This project demonstrates the implementation of a Naive Bayes classifier using Python and scikit-learn. The model is trained on a labeled dataset to predict class probabilities based on Bayes' Theorem with the na√Øve assumption of feature independence. It includes:
1.Preprocessing and feature encoding
2.Model training with Gaussian Naive Bayes
3.Evaluation using classification metrics and confusion matrix
4.Visualization of prediction outcomes and model performance
Ideal for understanding probabilistic classifiers and baseline performance in classification tasks.
